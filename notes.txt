---Fixed a bug where if user at item 32-34 at year 2019 changes to year 2020 (who has max 31 items), the app will disappear.
---This is because the year 2020 has no items 32-34, thus it will say undefined.

---Fixed a bug where if the user clicked on a year and is currently viewing the same year, then the item will reset to 1.
